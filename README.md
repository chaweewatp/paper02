## International Journal of Forecasting - Decision on Manuscript ID INTFOR_1808379<br/>


Dear Dr Singh:<br/>

I am writing concerning manuscript # INTFOR_1808379 entitled "Electricity price forecasting by using hybrid ANN and stochastic approach" which you submitted to the International Journal of Forecasting.<br/>

Modern research on electricity price forecasting is now focused on forecasting the probability distribution, as the upper tail of the distribution is of primary interest. Your paper focuses on point forecasting, using only the MAPE for comparison (which is not optimal for any characteristic of the underlying distribution). Please see some of the recent work we have published in this area for an up-to-date perspective on modern price research. Weron's review paper is another good resource, and you are obviously aware of it, although perhaps haven't read it carefully.<br/>

In the light of the comments above, I have chosen not to publish your manuscript in the International Journal of Forecasting. I know this will be disappointing to you, but we receive a large number of submissions and can only publish a small percentage of them.<br/>

Thank you for considering the International Journal of Forecasting for the publication of your research.  I hope the outcome of this specific submission will not discourage you from the submission of future manuscripts.<br/>

The reviews of your manuscript Manuscript Number:<br/>
 EAAI-18-2349, entitled: "Electricity price forecasting using hybrid ANN and stochastic approach" by Dr. Jai Govind Singh, Pornchai Chaweewat; , which you submitted to the International Scientific Journal Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence have now been received.<br/>

I regret to have to inform you that the referees recommended against acceptance of the paper for publication in the journal Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence. Please see below a copy of the various reviewer's remarks.<br/>

We sincerely appreciate having been given the opportunity to consider this manuscript; I hope that you will find the reviewer's remarks pertinent and helpful.<br/>

With very best wishes -<br/>

Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence<br/>

Reviewers' comments:<br/>

EAAI seeks for real world engineering applications which reports new knowledge on the AI domain.<br/>

When submitting a paper, it is necessary to provide complete and substantial algorithmic comparisons that illustrate why the proposed approach is preferable. It is also necessary to discuss the time benefits or disadvantages, as well as provide a robust complexity analysis. Besides, the manuscript has  has the following critical limitations:<br/>
1) Lack of significant contributions: the technical contributions are incremental, the proposed methodology has limited novelty, and the overall impact is not significant enough;<br/>
2) Weak experiments: experiments are not convincing enough; baselines are not strong (e.g., did not compare with state-of-the-art approaches). If a new AI method/theory is being reported in the paper, it should be compared and validated against at least one other common data set (bench mark data sets) for which a published study exists using at least one other method/approach, and preferably a method/approach which has been widely used in the field, and the data set should not be small.<br/>

Overall, the quality of the submission is below the acceptance bar.<br/>

Its originality on the AI domain being unclear, the article should better be submitted to a journal close to its application domain.<br/>

Comments from the Editor<br/>

This Editor does not recommend this paper for further review for the following basic reasons:<br/>
1. The paper does not comply with the minimum readability requirements for a journal publication and for a Review Team to be able to understand the paper's content.<br/>
2. It is really difficult to understand the paper's contribution and what the authors are actually doing.<br/>
3. Some of the assumptions made by the authors seem to be simplistic and unacceptable, such as the fact that they consider that prediction errors for PV and wind power output are normally distributed.<br/>


# Add note
We should add gamma distribution function analysis from collected data in each node. The apply this distribution function instead  with normal distribtion.

In the past VRE value is deterministic; can be view as a singular value <br/>
Now it can be seen by set of values with its probabilities or occurances.
